      Dr. Bernhard W. Adams, is a physicist with a background in
      lasers and x-ray optics.
      <br>
      His past work includes:
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>- Experiments on x-ray parametric down conversion</li>

        <li>- X-ray spectroscopy of molecular picosecond charge transfer using an x-ray streak camera</li>

        <li>- Coherence conversion for using transverse coherence in synhrotron radiation to achieve femtosecond time resolution in x-ray spectroscopy</li>

        <li>- Participation in the development of the Large-Area Picosecond Photodetector (LAPPD) <u><a class="text-blue-104" href="https://psec.uchicago.edu">psec.uchicago.edu</a></u></li>

      </ul>
      <br>
      His current research interests include:

      <ul>
        <li>- Applications of LAPPD technology in Hanbury Brown - Twiss astronomy</li>

        <li>- Applications of LAPPD technology in the bio-medical field (fluorescence
        lifetime imaging)</li>

        <li>- Applications of LAPPD technology in optical computing</li>

        <li>- Measurement of the Casimir force at sub-nanometer length scales</li>
      </ul>

      QOAR is affiliated with Dragonfly Devices, a sole proprietorship
      by the same owner, and Talos Precision, jointly with Martin Adams.
      These business entities pursue complementary activities, QOAR being set up
      for scientific consulting, Dragonfly Devices for opto-electronic hardware design, and
      Talos Precision for the design, manufacture, and sale of precision motion stages
      and CNC machines.
